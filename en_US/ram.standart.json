	"By composing Neon parts acting as small energy storages and a control device I designed a memory.I build the controller out of a silicon wafer contaminated by iron.",
	"This memory design is very fast, but the data must be rewritten periodically. This is caused by an energy loss of the small storages.",

	"Ram possess 2 critical properties: Their speed (§lram§r), which tells the general speed  of the system (refer Mainboard), and their cost (§lcorepower§r), which tells the performance needed from the processor."
