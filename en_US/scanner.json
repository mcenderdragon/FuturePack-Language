	"At the moment the mechanics of the E-Scanner, which I found in a structure from the Unreachable, is a big secret to me. But by trying to modify the device, I have found some interesting features which are not available normally.",
	"I named my new construct the \"Scanner\", because I can analyze and improve my technologies using that device. To do that I need a researched Item and some patience. The Unreachable-Technology helps me realize the possibilities, but I must choose the basic aspects I want to use by myself.",
	"If I created an implementable idea, the result will be printable as a Blueprint, to improve the technology.",

	"Usage in detail:",
	"After I put the Item I want to examine in the top left slot, the yellow bar shows me how many Researches are still available using this Item (relative to total).",
	"In the right area the 12 Aspects are placed, I must choose the matching 1 to 6 from them to find a new Research.",
	"Now in the middle area the \"Scan\"-Button shows up, which I can use to check the currently chosen combination. After an animation one of the following outputs can appear:",
	"Puzzle: The current selection is correct, but more aspects are needed.",
	"Golden star: Research successful. Blueprint can be taken.",
	"Yellow X: At least one of the chosen aspects is wrong.",
	"Red X: There are no researches for this Item.",
	"Green checkmark: All researches for this Item are finished.",
	"Yellow question mark: There are more Researches with this Item, but you don't have all conditions.",
	"Hint: A Blueprint can only be created until this research is completed in the Researcher, during this it is possible to generate other Blueprints using other Items or Aspects (as long they exist).",
	"Hint: On the left of the Blueprint-Slot is a button to open the Tech-Tree."
