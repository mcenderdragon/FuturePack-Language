	"A research principally contains 3 steps: concept, research, implementation.",
	"The concept is created by the scanner, with it you develop an Item (look at Scanner). This Item can be any one, the implementation of which is enabled by the predecessor technology (in Tech-Tree).",
	"A special case occurs if the/all predecessor technology are a \"Knowledge\"*. In this case you can get the name of the Item you have to use at the Knowledge-Description (black/at the and).",
	"The research is done in the Researcher, this takes resources and time to complete the concept. (that means it enables the entry of Tech-Tree).",
	"The implementation is typically the production of the Item/Block that was enabled. This is (among other things) needed to put the item into the Scanner for researching it's successors.",
	"",
	"The Tech-Tree:",
	"The Tech-Tree extends over multiple Tabs (selectable at the Border of the Screen). In the central area are research-icons existing in 3 types:",
	"Research - Can be researched, enables Items",

	"Dependent on the research progress there are 3 variants again:",
	"Solid and colored: It's completed and can be clicked to read it.",
	"Blinking and colored: It can be researched using the called way.",
	"Black: There are missing conditions for this research, the research is not possible at the moment.",
	"(automatic) Enabling and Conditions can be extended over more than one Tab, so it can be useful to look at some Tabs again later to see new researches." ,
	"The researches in each tab are connected with lines, reading direction is typically from left to right. You must always complete all conditions to unlock a research.",
	"Hint: It can happen that you need items for some implementations that you're not yet able to produce. In this case you must do other researches first and continue later.",
	"Hint: By clicking on Item-icons in a Research Description you can jump to the iesearch for this Item.",
	"",
	"An example (possible Spoiler):",
	"First, craft a scanner and a researcher at the Techtable, you can get the instructions for this at the corresponding entries of the Tech-Tree. You also need a Partpress (\"Production\"-Tab) for this task.",
	"The only possible Research is at the moment \"Production 1\":",
	{
		"type":"image",
		"width":16,
		"height":16,
		"resource":"fp:textures/aspects/production1.png"
	},
	"In the Tech-Tree you can see that the parent of this is \"Tectable\", which enables the equally named Block. That means we take a Techtable an put it into the Scanner. By combining or trying we find the right aspects (here Thermodynamics) and finally click on \"Scan\" again. So, we get a blueprint.",
	"In the second step we put this blueprint into the researcher and click the Research-button. The machine tells us, that we have to put 3 furnaces in the left Slot. After we have done that, the grey bar at the bottom of the Slot begins to fill. Once the bar is filled, we get a Chat-Message an we can see our result in the Tech-Tree (acessable by Scanner or E-Scanner)",
	"In this case we got the Knowledge \"Production 1\", in the Description we learn (among other things), that we must use an Industrial Furnace for the next research. And also that there are new Researches at the \"Production\"-Tab are available, logically the automatic enabled Industrial Furnace is under that.",
	"Now we have some points to continue with researching in both Tabs.",

	"Have fun expanding your knowledge :)"
