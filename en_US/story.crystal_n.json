	"I found a blueish glowing Crystal. After some analyses I would categorize this as an metallic Semiconductor-Crystal.",
	"Genesis:",
	"The Crystals grow, like the most crystalline structures, under heat and pressure, with the result that they are only traceable below the ground. Usually they form a sandy fertile soil, which has similar characteristics as the crystals.",
	"Refinement:",
	"Different to diamonds, the crystal structures are mostly composed of Silicon, this causes that they don't burn at high temperatures. The melting point is at 1.400°C. The materials can be refined by heating them up with a reducing agent, like carbon in form of coal or gas. By this process the crystals are transformed into handy ingots.",
	"Characteristics:",
	"The neon-materials work best at about 100°C. But they have a very low annealing temperature, so the most of them starts to glow at 18 - 32°C. This is a very special characteristic and caused the name Neoncrystal for the blue one I found. I think that there must be more types of crystals."
